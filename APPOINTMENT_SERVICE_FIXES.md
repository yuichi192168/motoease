# Appointment Booking and Service Request Fixes

## Issues Identified and Fixed

### 1. Appointment Booking Issues

**Problem**: The `appointments.php` file was calling non-existent functions in the Master.php class:
- `book_appointment` function was missing
- `check_appointment_availability` function was missing
- `appointments` table was missing from the database

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Added Missing Functions to Master.php**:
   - `book_appointment()` - Handles appointment booking with validation and availability checking
   - `check_appointment_availability()` - Checks if a time slot is available

2. **Created Appointments Table**:
   - Created `create_appointments_table.sql` with proper table structure
   - Added foreign key constraints to maintain data integrity
   - Includes fields: id, client_id, service_type, mechanic_id, appointment_date, appointment_time, vehicle_info, notes, status, date_created, date_updated

3. **Added Case Statements**:
   - Added `book_appointment` and `check_appointment_availability` cases to the switch statement in Master.php

### 2. Service Request Issues

**Problem**: The `save_request()` function had several issues:
- SQL construction for meta data was malformed
- Service ID array handling was incorrect
- Missing proper error handling

**Solutions Implemented**:

1. **Fixed SQL Construction**:
   - Improved the meta data array handling
   - Added proper error handling for meta data insertion
   - Fixed the SQL string concatenation issues

2. **Fixed Service ID Handling**:
   - Added logic to convert `service_id[]` array to comma-separated string for `service_type` field
   - Updated the field exclusion list to handle both `service_id` and `service_type`

3. **Enhanced Error Handling**:
   - Added proper validation and sanitization
   - Improved error messages and rollback functionality

## Files Modified

1. **classes/Master.php**:
   - Added `book_appointment()` function
   - Added `check_appointment_availability()` function
   - Fixed `save_request()` function
   - Added case statements for new functions

2. **create_appointments_table.sql** (New):
   - SQL script to create the appointments table

3. **setup_appointments.php** (New):
   - Script to execute the SQL and create the appointments table

## Database Changes Required

Run the following to create the appointments table:
```sql
-- Execute create_appointments_table.sql
-- Or run setup_appointments.php in your browser
```

## Testing

After implementing these fixes:

1. **Appointment Booking**:
   - Users can now book appointments through the appointments.php page
   - Time slot availability is checked before booking
   - Proper validation and error handling

2. **Service Requests**:
   - Service requests can be submitted through send_request.php
   - Multiple services can be selected
   - Vehicle information is properly stored
   - Meta data is correctly handled

## Notes

- The appointments table uses proper foreign key constraints
- All user inputs are properly sanitized
- Error handling has been improved throughout
- The system maintains data integrity with proper rollback mechanisms
