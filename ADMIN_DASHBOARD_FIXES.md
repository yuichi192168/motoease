# Admin Dashboard Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. User Log History Not Displaying
**Problem**: The user log history page existed but was not accessible from the navigation menu.

**Solution**: 
- Added "User Activity Log" menu item to the Reports section in `admin/inc/navigation.php`
- Updated the navigation menu to include the user_log_history page in the active menu detection

### 2. Brand and Category Dropdowns Not Clickable
**Problem**: The brand and category dropdowns in the product management page were not properly initialized with Select2.

**Solution**:
- Added proper Select2 initialization for brand and category dropdowns in `admin/products/manage_product.php`
- Set `dropdownParent: $('body')` to ensure proper modal display
- Added `allowClear: true` for better user experience

### 3. Missing save_brand Function
**Problem**: The brand management was calling a `save_brand` function that didn't exist in the Master class.

**Solution**:
- Added `save_brand()` function to `classes/Master.php`
- Added `delete_brand()` function for brand deletion
- Added proper file upload handling for brand logos
- Added the function to the switch statement for AJAX calls

### 4. Missing Other Essential Functions
**Problem**: Several other functions were missing from the Master class.

**Solution**: Added the following functions to `classes/Master.php`:
- `save_mechanic()` - For mechanic management
- `delete_mechanic()` - For mechanic deletion
- `update_order_status()` - For order status updates
- `update_document_status()` - For document status management
- `delete_document()` - For document deletion
- `add_account_balance()` - For customer account balance management
- `update_vehicle_info()` - For vehicle information updates
- `upload_orcr_document()` - For OR/CR document uploads

### 5. Maintenance Dashboard Not Working
**Problem**: The maintenance index page was commented out and not functional.

**Solution**:
- Uncommented and completely rewrote `admin/maintenance/index.php`
- Created a proper maintenance dashboard with:
  - Statistics cards showing counts of brands, categories, services, and mechanics
  - Quick action buttons for easy navigation
  - Recent activity table showing latest brands and categories

### 6. Missing Scripts in Admin Header
**Problem**: The admin header was missing essential JavaScript libraries.

**Solution**: Added the following scripts to `admin/inc/header.php`:
- Bootstrap 4 bundle
- DataTables (jQuery, Bootstrap4, Responsive)
- Select2 full version
- Summernote editor
- AdminLTE app

### 7. Config Path Issue
**Problem**: The Master.php file had an incorrect path to the config file.

**Solution**:
- Fixed the require path in `classes/Master.php` to use `__DIR__.'/../config.php'`

### 8. Description Template System
**Problem**: The product management page had a description template system that needed improvement.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced the template system with better templates for different product types
