# ID Zero Issue - FIXED ✅

## Problem
Service requests and appointments were getting ID 0 when submitted, causing issues with:
- Viewing details
- Cancelling appointments/requests
- Database integrity

## Root Cause
The database tables were missing:
1. **Primary Key constraints** on the `id` fields
2. **AUTO_INCREMENT** settings on the `id` fields

## Solution Applied

### 1. Fixed Database Schema
```sql
-- Added primary keys
ALTER TABLE appointments ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);
ALTER TABLE service_requests ADD PRIMARY KEY (id);

-- Set auto-increment
ALTER TABLE appointments MODIFY id int(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;
ALTER TABLE service_requests MODIFY id int(30) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT;
```

### 2. Fixed Existing Zero IDs
- Updated all existing records with `id=0` to proper sequential IDs
- Ensured no data loss during the fix

### 3. Verified Backend Code
- ✅ `classes/Master.php` already uses `$this->conn->insert_id` correctly
- ✅ Both appointment and service request creation functions work properly
- ✅ No code changes needed

## Test Results
```
✅ Appointment created with ID: 28
✅ Service request created with ID: 21  
✅ Master class appointment booking successful - ID: 29
```

## Current Status
- ✅ **Appointments**: Auto-increment working, new records get proper IDs
- ✅ **Service Requests**: Auto-increment working, new records get proper IDs
- ✅ **Existing Data**: All zero IDs fixed, no data loss
- ✅ **Backend Code**: Already using correct `insert_id` methods
- ✅ **Client Interface**: Will now receive proper IDs for viewing/cancelling

## Files Modified
- Database schema (appointments and service_requests tables)
- No code changes required

## Verification
The issue is completely resolved. New service requests and appointments will now get proper sequential IDs instead of 0, allowing all functionality to work correctly.
